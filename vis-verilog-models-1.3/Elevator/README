elevator.vpp is buggy.  Initialization is incorrect when the number of
floors is a power of 2.

elevatorFixed.vpp is the corrected version.  elevator1-4.{v,mv} are obtained
from it.  The remaining .v and .mv file were produced with the buggy .vpp.

The property in elevator.ctl only makes sense for 3 or 4 floors.
