example.

bufferAlloc.v
bufferAlloc.mv
bufferAlloc.ord
bufferAlloc.ctl
bufferAlloc.inv

----- buf_bug -----
This version has a problem with the order of execution of statements.
Use bufferAlloc.inv to show problem.  Specifically, nack is computed
using the old value of alloc, while count is computed using the new
one.
