slider.v:

This example illustrates a reduction of the common slider
game to FSM reachability.  The latches correspond to grid
points, their value is the tile at that location. Amusingly,
exactly half  of all configurations are reachable. It is worth
experimenting with asynchonous implementations of this game, to
see the speedup afforded.
