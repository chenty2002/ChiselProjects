   8 registers, program is in stored in ROM 
                                                                   
   Instructions are of two type - alu operation and conditional jump
   The first kind look like OP src_reg1, src_reg2, destn_reg       
   The second are like JMP r1 r2: if the contents of r1 is zero,  
   set the pc to the contents of r2                              
                                                                
   In this way the instruction is 11 bits wide - 2 for the opcode,
   3 for src_reg1, 3 for src_reg2, and 3 for destn_reg           
                                                                 
   As you might expect, programming such a processor is a royal pain 
   Perhaps we will write an assembler for it someday.               
                                                                   
   Possible extensions - pipeline and add bypass/stall logic, add 
   operands.
